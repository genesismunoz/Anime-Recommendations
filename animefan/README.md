Anime Fan

Uses the Jikan API to retreive anime infromation. 

Users can view the current top anime on the sidebar, a ranking that is updated by Jikan. 

Users can view my personal favorite anime recomendations on the sidebar as well. Originally the idea was to make it more of a blog/database site, future blog aspects could be added later on but for now only the 'G approved' animes were kept.

Users can search up any anime they'd like and can browse the results. Each anime result will have the sypnosis show up when hovered upon and will display its original japanese name. 

Demo can be used to navigate app.
